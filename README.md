## Permissions

```

### Why These Permissions Are Used

| `storage` | Saves settings, API key, chat mode settings, and domain memory locally |
| `scripting` | Injects the overlay UI, crop UI, markdown parser, and sanitizer into pages |
| `activeTab` | Allows the extension to interact with the current active tab after user action |
| `tabs` | Gets the current tab URL/domain and captures the visible tab for image cropping |

---

## Host Permissions

```json
[
  "https://*/*",
  "http://*/*",
  "https://api.openai.com/*"
]
```

### Why Host Permissions Are Used

| Host Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `https://*/*` | Allows the extension to work on HTTPS websites |
| `http://*/*` | Allows the extension to work on HTTP websites |
| `https://api.openai.com/*` | Allows requests to the OpenAI API |

---

## Settings

The Options page includes:

- OpenAI API Key

All settings are stored locally in the browser using `chrome.storage.local`.

Ask ChatGPT (crop image area)
```

### Text Request Flow

```text
Highlight text
→ Right-click
→ Ask ChatGPT (selected text)
→ Send selected text to OpenAI

```

```

### Chat Mode Flow

→ Continue the conversation
```

### Summary Mode Flow

```text
Conversation reaches summary limit
→ Generate summary
→ Reset conversation ID
→ Reuse summary as compact context
```

## Web Accessible Resources

The extension exposes the following files to webpages when needed:

```json
[
  "summary.txt",
  "marked.umd.js",
  "purify.min.js"
]
```

These are used for:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `summary.txt` | Stores the prompt used for conversation summarization |
| `marked.umd.js` | Renders Markdown responses in the overlay |
| `purify.min.js` | Sanitizes rendered HTML before displaying it |

## Memory

The Memory tab shows saved domains when Chat Mode is enabled and conversations have been saved.

You can delete saved history for each domain individually.

Example:

```text
github.com
openai.com
stackoverflow.com
```

Each domain stores its own conversation context.

---

## Privacy

- The OpenAI API key is stored locally in the browser.
- Settings are stored using `chrome.storage.local`.
- No custom backend server is used.
- Requests are sent directly from the extension to the OpenAI API.
- Chat history is optional and depends on Chat Mode.
- Domain-based conversation memory can be deleted from the Memory tab.

---

## Limitations

- The extension does not work on restricted Chrome pages such as `chrome://extensions`.
- Image mode uses the visible tab screenshot, so only the visible part of the page can be cropped.
- Summary Mode is optional and only useful when Chat Mode is enabled.
- Lower `maxOutputTokens` can reduce cost, but may shorten answers.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Add draggable overlay UI
- Add conversation export
- Add better image search support
- Add custom prompt presets
- Add light/dark theme setting
